  ;; TODO: flexible pitch notation, ideally for multiple tunings. 
  ;; I already have ji-pitch-symbol->ratio, which is a step into that direction, together with ratio->keynum. It allows to express JI pitches with symbolic note names, and to map them to some ET. 

  ;; However, I need to use JI notation correctly to approximate pitches in different tunings correctly. I cannot simply use the "best" notation for each tuning with this approach. For example, I have to notate the syntonic comma of 5/4 in meantone, otherwise I may end up at the wrong pitch. 
  (mod (ratio->keynum (ji-pitch-symbol->ratio :E-5) 31) 31) ; 9.979770941508235 -- correct, E is 10 in 31et
  (mod (ratio->keynum (ji-pitch-symbol->ratio :E5) 31) 31) ; 10.53535008942336 -- this is almost E| in 31et

  ;; To get the "right" notation for any ET, I really need to define them individually, like in Strasheela? 
  ;; I could likely define them with a regular temperament, where the temperament of the period interval (e.g., the fifth) and its notation is defined, i.e., not only the tuning of accidentals, but also of the nominals can be user-specified.

  ;; TODO: there is a BUG: combination of accidentals such as :Bb70 are not working. 
  ;; If I allow for accidental consisting of multiple characters later, then this is not trivial to add. With HEWM notation, I could simply split the accidentals into multiple characters, and interpret each character as its own accidents. With Sagittal I will likely not need any composite accidentals. So, I could have an extra optional argument specifying how to deal wit accidentals consisting of multiple characters. 
  ;; If I want to be even more flexible, then I could implement some proper parsing, but likely I never need that...
